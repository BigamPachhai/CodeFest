[dotenv@17.2.3] injecting env (15) from .env -- tip: 📡 add observability to secrets: https://dotenvx.com/ops
(node:33447) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/bigampachhai/Documents/CodeFest/server/server.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/bigampachhai/Documents/CodeFest/server/package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
